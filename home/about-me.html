        <p class="italic bold medium file-title"><span class="highlight">Designer.</span></p>
        <p class="file-caption">Well-versed in sustainable urbanism, planning, and GIS as well as in traditional fine arts,
          graphic, and digital media, I have always had a passion for creativity, however manifested. I strive to channel this affinity
          into designing solutions, whether they be for large-scale issues such as the increasing need for resilience in face of climate change
          or for a small intervention for a specifically targeted user with the potential for a broader impact.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="file-analyst" class="file">
        <p class="italic bold medium file-title"><span class="highlight">Analyst.</span></p>
        <p class="file-caption">Design should not be a perpetuation of arbitrary aesthetics but a development of a deep understanding
          of a subject. By analyzing past trends to interpolate the present and envision future potential, design can harness data
          to more effeciently and effectively improve quality of life. From the subatomic particles that make up matter to the layers of history underlying urban
          environments, the world is composed of such information - particularly in this technological age. GIS and urban spatial
          analytics are about more than simply making sense of US Census data; it is how this data is utilized to inform decision-making.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="file-human" class="file">
        <p class="italic bold medium file-title"><span class="highlight">Human.</span></p>
        <p class="file-caption">But as professions, both designers and analysts are susceptible to becoming disengaged from the "real world,"
          obscured by lofty goals and poetic lyricism. Successful design is driven by purpose, but a successful designer is
          driven by compassion. I firmly believe in the strength of my values, but I also recognize my faults because these qualities make me human
          and ultimately are what qualify me for the position. I hope to take advantage of my interdisciplinary background and help bridge
          the wide array of fields that are increasingly interconnected by applying both creative and analytical perspectives to design better solutions for people.</p></div>
