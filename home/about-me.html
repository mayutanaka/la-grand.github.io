              <p class="blackbox space-bottom">Well-versed in sustainable urbanism, planning, and GIS as well
                as in traditional fine arts, graphic, and digital media, I have always had a passion for creativity, however manifested. I
                strive to channel this affinity into designing solutions, whether they be for large-scale issues such as
                the increasing need for resilience in face of climate change or for a small intervention for a specifically targeted
                user with the potential for a broader impact.</p>

            <div class="carousel-caption">
              <p class="italic bold medium space-bottom"><span class="highlight-black">Analyst.</span></p>
              <p class="blackbox space-bottom">Design should not be a perpetuation of arbitrary aesthetics but a development of a deep understanding
                of a subject. By analyzing past trends to interpolate the present and envision future potential, design can harness data
                to more effeciently and effectively improve quality of life. From the subatomic particles that make up matter to the layers of history underlying urban
                environments, the world is composed of such information - particularly in this technological age. GIS and urban spatial
                analytics are about more than simply making sense of US Census data; it is how this data is utilized to inform decision-making.</p>

            <div class="carousel-caption">
              <p class="italic bold medium space-bottom"><span class="highlight-black">Human.</span></p>
              <p class="blackbox space-bottom">But as professions, both designers and analysts are susceptible to becoming disengaged from the "real world,"
                obscured by lofty goals and poetic lyricism. Successful design is driven by purpose, but a successful designer is
                driven by compassion. I firmly believe in the strength of my values, but I also recognize my faults because these qualities make me human
                and ultimately are what qualify me for the position. I hope to take advantage of my interdisciplinary background and help bridge
                the wide array of fields that are increasingly interconnected by applying both creative and analytical perspectives to design better solutions for people.</p>
